## Overview

This project hosts a set of config settings to play **League of Legends** with [WASD](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/news/dev/dev-wasd-controls-are-on-the-way/) for those who want to use a D-pad on macOS.

Supported Device:

- [Razer Tartarus V2](https://www.razer.com/gaming-keypads/razer-tartarus-v2)


## Prerequisite

1. Install [Karabiner\-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) to remap the keybindings, since the official **Razer Synapse 2** no longer supports the latest macOS versions.
